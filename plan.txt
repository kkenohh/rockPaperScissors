PLAN:
*I forgot to plan first and already did the getComputerChoice function, but it was easy*



how will I order the answers?
options: array? object? 

or i could just hardcode it and find a way to make the code shorter later. (coming back to this, I don't think I need to change it, it's not as bad as I thought)

in order to make the player selection be case-insensitive, I'll make both answers lowercase.

the game function seems pretty straightforward, I don't think I'll need to plan anything.
