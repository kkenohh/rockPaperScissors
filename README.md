## Introduction

Oops, I forgot to write something before I started. Honestly, I don't think it's necessary anyways because I feel pretty confident when it comes to OOP and Java language.

## Analysis

I finished this with close to no hitches. The only hitch came because I didn't realize that my Sources don't update when I save it. I have to reload the whole page instead to update my changes from the actual file. I think I did pretty good, which was my expectation since I've taken 3 Java programming classes. I BETTER have been able to code this without much issue. This was relatively easy and I can't wait to put this together with html and css to create an actual webpage.

After I started adding comments, I realized I'm very rusty in this aspect. My goal is to get better at making clear comments for others.


## Introduction

Forgot an introduction to this part.

## Analysis

Holy cow. This was so great. I got a much better understanding of how to use JS, HTML, and CSS together. Wow. I absolutely loved this project and it was really hard figuring stuff out, but man I learned a lot.

I don't remember every single problem I came across, but here are the ones I do remember:

- I didn't know you couldn't have a font-family in the * selector when using FontAwesome icons
- I couldn't figure out how to get the button to play a game for the longest time. It was just very confusing for me
- I didn't know how to access the class of the element that was clicked for awhile

There were lots of other JS-HTML struggles I had, but honestly, this way of learning is a lot better for me because I can see my mistake and figure out how to fix it myself. Then, it's much easier to remember what went wrong and how to fix it.

Overall, this was a great project that I'm super proud of. I think I could make it better, but I would like to move on to other topics so I can learn as much as I can before school starts again.
