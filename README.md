## Introduction

Oops, I forgot to write something before I started. Honestly, I don't think it's necessary anyways because I feel pretty confident when it comes to OOP and Java language.

## Analysis

I finished this with close to no hitches. The only hitch came because I didn't realize that my Sources don't update when I save it. I have to reload the whole page instead to update my changes from the actual file. I think I did pretty good, which was my expectation since I've taken 3 Java programming classes. I BETTER have been able to code this without much issue. This was relatively easy and I can't wait to put this together with html and css to create an actual webpage.

After I started adding comments, I realized I'm very rusty in this aspect. My goal is to get better at making clear comments for others.
